gx doesn't select the full URL
paste inside braces, quotes, etc., maybe sustitute does that already
s is now substitute, maybe a new mapping for xi
start by reviewing kickstart code (down to modeline)
when something not as expected `:verbose set <setting>?` explains what last set it
nvim-lspconfig doesn't allow 4t formatting
`:help vim.opt`, `:help option-list`, `:help vim.keymap.set()`
`:help lua-guide-autocommands`
lost tree toggle and related todos
2 diagonstics
nvim-tree overwrites Tab to preview file
read :help and use <leader>sh
nvim-web-dev-icons or w/e disabled, why; other plugins also not enabled (:Lazy)
both tab and enter autocomplete; only tab and allow going to next line
   can tab only once on new lines before suggestions show up and overtake the key press
Run :Lazy; some packages are not 'started'?
	learn Lazy, difference between update, sync, etc.
Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
what makes spaces look better than tabs? undo space aspect and use here
blue at top, line separating windows - adjust theme?
create zsh shorcuts for Documents, sahbox, vin config, etc.
link this repo in place of current config, compare with latest kickstart
use sessions if they work as intended (open dirs/workspaces with cached files)
structure into files, look up how pros do it (0 to LSP Linux bookmark, GPT)
maybe remove auto whitespace trimming - or just don't trim on write - 3 plugins
	won't auto format on save and other plugins have the same problem?
	maybe the problem is saving on undo/redo, but how can you fix it?
https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev/videos
	something for bulk find, replace, edit, etc.
compare with kickstart configuration (check README)
checkhealth
auto :!clang-format -i <path>
dir structure: nvim/lua/user/...lua?
a lot of keymaps are not useful; remap them
auto format and wrap line at limit on save (variable = '89' or whatever used across)
whitespace trimming breaks undo
multiple terminals - is tmux necessary? separate "tab"(? i.e. window) would be nice
cleanup all the install paths + config/local/cache
html intending is broken for html-ul-li
shortcuts for putting text from clipboard on a new line even though it doesn't have one
	or to separate on a new line, like the inverse of j/J and take care of spaces in any context
