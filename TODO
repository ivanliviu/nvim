telescope should include . files, maybe not build etc.
bind terminal to its window / buffers always in window 1
holding keys (e.g. space) dones't work - what (plugin) causes it? noticed after centering plugin?
map space to nothing
something for o/O<Esc>
s is now substitute, maybe a new mapping for xi
paste inside braces, quotes, etc., maybe sustitute does that already
start by reviewing kickstart code (down to modeline)
when something not as expected `:verbose set <setting>?` explains what last set it
nvim-lspconfig doesn't allow 4t formatting
nvim-web-dev-icons or w/e disabled, why; other plugins also not enabled (:Lazy)
both tab and enter autocomplete; only tab and allow going to next line
   can tab only once on new lines before suggestions show up and overtake the key press
learn Lazy, difference between update, sync, etc.
create zsh shorcuts for Documents, sahbox, vin config, etc.
link this repo in place of current config, compare with latest kickstart
structure into files, look up how pros do it (0 to LSP Linux bookmark, GPT)
bulk find, replace, edit, etc.
checkhealth
remap unused keybinds [a-z]->[A-Z]-><C-[a-z]>
whitespace trimming breaks undo
multiple terminals - is tmux necessary? separate "tab"(? i.e. window) would be nice
cleanup all the install paths + config/local/cache
html intending is broken for html-ul-li
shortcuts for putting text from clipboard on a new line even though it doesn't have one
	or to separate on a new line, like the inverse of j/J and take care of spaces in any context
add as basic linux requirements: 'git', 'make', 'unzip', 'rg'
	make sure there are plugins that do need them and they don't exist by default

TIPS:
:Telescope help_tags
`:help vim.opt`, `:help option-list`, `:help vim.keymap.set()` `:help lua-guide-autocommands`
read :help and use <leader>sh
	e.g. lazy.nvim-plugin
	continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
